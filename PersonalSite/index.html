    <h3>Biography</h3>

    <p class="blue-bg text">Hello! My name is Joey Garza and I'm excited to be taking this course! I was enlisted in the <b>USAF</b> from 2010-2015 during that time I was a C-17 Crew Chief. After being <i>medically discharged</i> life was pretty much all over the place. I worked in construction, mechanical engineering, personal training, sales and I couldn't really find my calling. Until, <del>the world's greatest year</del>, 2020 when my mental health hit a new low. I knew I wanted to help others, like me, that just needed someone to talk to. So, June 2020 I founded my nonprofit organization <mark>Above the Stigma</mark>. </p>
    <p class="green-bg text">Above the Stigma, <small>ATS</small>, helps individuals find safe spaces to find their voice. We all work together to normalize the hard but <ins>real conversations</ins>. We are now bringing mental health curriculums into schools and having professionals teach the students everything there is to know about their mental health. This organization has helped so many people already and I can't wait to see what else is to come! </p>
    <p>This all brings me to now. I am wanting to expand my knowledge with this FSDI bootcamp and see where these skills can improve my future. Creating a bright pathway for myself and hopefully helping others is my mission. Remember, at the end of the day YOU<sub>2</sub> MATTER<sub>3</sub>! </p>
